# Landmark-Retrieval
The project aims to classification the KLE Tech dataset, which consists of about
15,268 images of College Campus containing 30 classes including
Circles and Buildings. We tried with VGG-19 architecture
and discussed results. We also build an application
and deployed it on android machines which can help in identifying
the campus images. Overall, the approach of training
deep learning models on increasingly large and publicly
available image datasets presents a clear path towards smartphone
assisted detection of campus.
